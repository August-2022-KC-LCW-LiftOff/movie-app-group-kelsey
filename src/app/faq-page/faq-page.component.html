        <h2 class="deep-purple">About <span class="red">Triggered</span></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">What is <span class="red">Triggered</span>?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="red">Triggered</span> is a movie trigger warning review app. 
          We like to call it a safe space for movie lovers. People love movies because 
          they offer an escape from the real world, but sometimes aspects of the movies 
          we enjoy trigger us. This can change a person’s movie watching experience 
          (trust us, we know firsthand). To help make sure spend more time enjoying
          a movie than being triggered by it, our app displays community reported
          triggers to warn others of possibly upsetting or triggering content.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          With <span class="red">Triggered</span>, you can search our movie database to 
          view trigger warnings left by other movie watchers, so you can prepare yourself 
          before seeing the movie. And when you create an account on our site, it makes 
          you an authorized user and allows you to create trigger warning reviews for others.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">Why do I need to create an account?</h3>
        <p>
          Our site allows you to read reviews and learn about trigger warnings for classic,
          latest, and most popular movies. Though this comes in handy for a one-off search,
          you may discover a trigger that wasn’t previously reported. To create a trigger 
          warning for others and save any movies for future reference, you must become an
          authorized user by creating an account.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">How do I create a review?</h3>
        <p>
          To create a trigger warning review, first search for the desired
          movie in the search bar. Next, fill out the add trigger form 
          underneath the movie’s description. Select two trigger warnings
          and leave a summary of the trigger. Your summary can include 
          a time stamp or explanation of the scene to further inform other users. 
          Once complete, click “add trigger tag,” to submit your review. 
          Note: It may take up to 5 days for your review to display on the page.

        <h3 class="deep-purple">
          What if I don't see a trigger category and want to suggest one?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Although we currently have 20 trigger categories to choose from, 
          you may discover a new category, or have a suggestion for a subcategory 
          to add. Thank you so much for your dedication to making <span class="red">Triggered</span> 
          a safe space for movie watchers! Please email us at triggeredsupport@gmail.com with 
          the subject line: “Trigger category suggestion”

        <h3 class="deep-purple">
          How do I add/remove items to/from my favorites list?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, our app currently does not support adding/removing items 
          to and from the “my favorites” list. This feature is in the works, 
          and we hope to have it running shortly!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">How do ratings work?</h3>
        <p>
          Rating movie reviews is a feature our app currently does not support. 
          We apologize for its absence, but this feature is in the works, 
          and we hope to have it running in the near future!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">Why do some movies/shows have so few reviews?</h3>
        <p>
          There are several reasons why a movie doesn’t have many reviews: 
          our community didn’t find the movie triggering, not people have 
          viewed the movie, or simply, users haven’t created an account to 
          leave a review. If the latter is the case, don’t let another person 
          potentially get triggered! See a need, fill a need, and leave the review 
          for others. You never know you can help.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">Who can create reviews?</h3>
        <p>
          At this time, only authorized users aka those who have created an account 
          on the <span class="red">Triggered</span> app can create a trigger warning review. 
          If you aren’t interested in creating an account, never fear! You can still search 
          our database of movies for trigger reviews created by others in the community.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="deep-purple">When will you post my review?</h3>
        <p>
          To make sure that our movie watcher community stays safe, we have 
          to vet each trigger warning review for accuracy. Because we are a 
          team of four, it may be up to three days before you see your trigger 
          warning review. If it has been longer than three days, please email us 
          a triggeredsupport@gmail.com and we’d be happy to investigate!
